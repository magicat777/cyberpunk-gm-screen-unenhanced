# Filesystem Notes Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added filesystem access functionality to the Notes panel, allowing users to save and load notes directly from their Documents folder using the modern File System Access API.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created NotesFilesystemManager (`src/js/notes-filesystem-manager.js`)
- Implements File System Access API for secure file operations
- Supports multiple file formats:
  - Plain text (.txt)
  - Markdown (.md)
  - HTML (.html)
  - JSON (.json)
- Features:
  - Format conversion between HTML, Markdown, and plain text
  - Remembers last used directory
  - Proper error handling and user feedback
  - Falls back to download/upload for unsupported browsers

### 2. Enhanced Notes Editor (`src/js/notes-text-editor.js`)
- Added filesystem buttons to toolbar:
  - üìÅ Save to Documents
  - üìÇ Load from Documents
- Integrated with filesystem manager
- Maintains all existing functionality

### 3. Updated Main HTML (`cyberpunk-gm-screen.html`)
- Added script include for filesystem manager
- Modified `createNotesPanel()` to use enhanced editor when available
- Falls back to basic textarea if enhanced editor fails

## How to Use

1. **Save to Documents**:
   - Click the üìÅ button in the Notes panel toolbar
   - Choose format (text, markdown, or HTML)
   - Select save location in Documents folder
   - File is saved with appropriate extension

2. **Load from Documents**:
   - Click the üìÇ button in the Notes panel toolbar
   - Browse to your saved note file
   - Content is automatically converted to HTML for editing
   - Original format is preserved for saving

## Security Features
- Uses modern File System Access API
- Requires explicit user permission for each file operation
- No automatic file access without user interaction
- Sandboxed within browser security model

## Browser Compatibility
- **Full Support**: Chrome/Edge 86+, Opera 72+
- **Fallback Mode**: Firefox, Safari (uses download/upload)
- All browsers maintain full editing functionality

## File Format Support
- **Text Files (.txt)**: Plain text, converts line breaks to HTML
- **Markdown (.md)**: Full markdown syntax with HTML conversion
- **HTML Files (.html)**: Native format, no conversion needed
- **JSON Files (.json)**: Stores content with metadata

## Testing
Created `test-notes-filesystem.html` to verify implementation:
- Checks script loading
- Tests filesystem manager methods
- Verifies button creation
- Tests format conversion

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add auto-save to Documents option
2. Implement file watching for external changes
3. Add recent files menu
4. Support for cloud storage providers
