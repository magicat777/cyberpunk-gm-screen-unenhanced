# Deploy to Cyberpunk GM Screen Unenhanced Repository

Since we've made all the updates in the wrong repository, here are the steps to transfer everything to the correct `cyberpunk-gm-screen-unenhanced` repository:

## Manual Steps Required

1. **Clone the correct repository** (in a separate terminal/location):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/magicat777/cyberpunk-gm-screen-unenhanced.git
   cd cyberpunk-gm-screen-unenhanced
   ```

2. **Copy all the updated files** from this repository to the unenhanced one:
   ```bash
   # From the cyberpunk-gm-screen-unenhanced directory:
   cp -r ../cyberpunk-gm-screen/cyberpunk-gm-screen/* .
   ```

3. **Add and commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Cyberpunk GM Screen v2.0 with Night City map, user profiles, and filesystem integration

   This major update completes the cyberpunk GM screen project by implementing the final 5% of features:
   
   - Interactive Night City map with districts, locations, and encounter hotspots
   - User profile management system with theme, layout, and sound preference saving
   - Filesystem access for notes with Documents folder integration
   - Enhanced panel system with fixed positioning and syntax issues
   - Comprehensive administration guide with UML diagrams
   - Fixed sound system object references and volume controls
   - Resolved panel creation JavaScript syntax errors
   - Updated all panel positioning to avoid menu tray overlap
   - Enhanced notes editor with improved padding
   - Added extensive test coverage"
   ```

4. **Push to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Update GitHub Pages** (if using gh-pages branch):
   ```bash
   git checkout gh-pages
   git merge main
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

   Or if GitHub Pages is configured to use main branch, it should automatically deploy.

## Key Files Added/Updated

- `cyberpunk-gm-screen.html` - Main application with all panel fixes
- `src/js/night-city-map.js` - Interactive Night City map
- `src/js/user-profile-manager.js` - User profile system
- `src/js/notes-filesystem-manager.js` - Filesystem access for notes
- `src/styles/themes.css` - Fixed Netrunner theme
- `CYBERPUNK_GM_SCREEN_ADMINISTRATION_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Verification

After deployment, the enhanced Cyberpunk GM Screen should be available at:
https://magicat777.github.io/cyberpunk-gm-screen-unenhanced/

All features should work including:
- Night City interactive map in World Building menu
- User profile management in Settings panel
- Filesystem save/load in Notes panel
- Fixed sound controls
- Proper panel positioning
- All syntax errors resolved
