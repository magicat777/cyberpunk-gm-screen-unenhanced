# Panel Boundary Fixes - January 27, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Panel Dragging Constraints
- Panels can no longer be dragged under the header
- Panels can no longer be dragged off-screen
- Added 10px margin from all viewport edges
- Drag boundaries respect header height and footer height dynamically

### 2. Maximize Feature
- Fixed maximize to respect header and footer boundaries
- Maximized panels now properly fill the available space between header and footer
- Uses CSS calc() to ensure proper sizing
- Prevents overflow beyond viewport

### 3. Panel Creation Boundaries
- New panels are automatically positioned within viewport bounds
- If requested position would place panel off-screen, it's adjusted to fit
- Default positions offset each new panel by 30px to prevent stacking
- Panel sizes are constrained to fit within available space

### 4. Panel Resizing Constraints
- Panels cannot be resized larger than the remaining viewport space
- Resize respects position of panel and available space to the right/bottom
- Minimum sizes maintained (200px width, 150px height)
- Maximum sizes prevent panels from extending beyond viewport

### 5. Fit All to Screen
- Properly calculates available space excluding header and footer
- Limits panel sizes to reasonable maximums (800x600)
- Distributes panels evenly in a grid layout
- Ensures all panels remain visible and accessible

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Changes (enhanced-panel-system-fixed.js):
1. `handleDragMove()` - Added viewport boundary checking
2. `createPanel()` - Validates and adjusts initial positions
3. `applyState()` - Fixed maximized state positioning
4. `fitAllToScreen()` - Proper space calculation
5. `handleResizeMove()` - Added resize constraints

### CSS Changes (enhanced-panels-fixed.css):
1. `.panel.maximized` - Uses viewport-relative positioning
2. Respects `--header-height` CSS variable
3. Uses `calc()` for dynamic height calculation

## Usage Notes

- Panels will automatically snap to valid positions if dragged out of bounds
- The maximize button now creates a proper full-screen experience within the app bounds
- Creating multiple panels will cascade them slightly to prevent perfect overlap
- Resizing is smooth and constrained to prevent UI breaking

## Testing
- Tested with various viewport sizes
- Verified header/footer respect
- Confirmed no panels can be "lost" off-screen
- Maximize/restore cycle works properly
