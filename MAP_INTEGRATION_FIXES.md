# Night City Map Integration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **createMapPanel is not defined Error**
**Problem**: The createMapPanel function was not available when the button was clicked.

**Solution**: 
- Added `panel-implementations-fixed.js` to the script includes in `cyberpunk-gm-screen.html`
- Created a fallback `createMapPanel` function in the main HTML that:
  - Checks if the panel-implementations version is available
  - Falls back to a direct implementation if needed
  - Properly initializes the Night City Map component

### 2. **Service Worker CORS Error**
**Problem**: Service Worker registration failed when opening the file locally (file:// protocol).

**Solution**: 
- Added protocol check before service worker registration
- Only registers service worker on http/https protocols
- Prevents CORS errors when testing locally

### 3. **Script Loading Order**
**Fix Applied**:
```html
<!-- Added after other panel scripts -->
<script src="src/js/panel-implementations-fixed.js"></script>
<!-- Night City Map loads near the end -->
<script src="src/js/night-city-map.js"></script>
```

### 4. **Menu Integration**
**Location**: World Building section of left menu tray
```html
<button class="tray-btn" onclick="createMapPanel()">
  <span class="icon">üó∫Ô∏è</span> Night City Map
</button>
```

## Testing

### Test Files Created:
1. `test-night-city-map.html` - Standalone map component test
2. `test-map-integration.html` - Integration verification test

### How to Test:
1. Open `cyberpunk-gm-screen.html` in a browser
2. Click the menu button (‚ò∞) to open the left tray
3. Expand "World Building" section
4. Click "Night City Map"

### Expected Result:
- A 900x750px panel opens with the interactive Night City map
- Canvas displays all districts with different colors
- Controls allow toggling layers and zooming
- Clicking districts shows information
- No console errors

## Other Console Warnings

### AudioContext Warnings
These are browser security features and are normal:
- AudioContext requires user interaction to start
- Will auto-resume after first user click

### Performance Warnings
The low FPS warnings (22-23 FPS) may occur during initial load:
- This is temporary during asset loading
- Performance should stabilize after initialization
