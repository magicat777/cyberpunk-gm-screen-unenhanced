- Significant improvements and new features added

### Proposed Strategy: **"Cyberpunk GM Screen UN-Enhanced Edition"** 🎮

#### Option 1: New Repository (Recommended)
**Repository Name**: `cyberpunk-gm-screen-unenhanced`

**Advantages**:
- Clean start with new architecture
- No legacy code conflicts
- Clear version distinction
- Can reference original as inspiration

**Version**: `3.0.0-alpha`

#### Option 2: Branch Strategy
- Create `v3-unenhanced` branch
- Maintain parallel development
- Eventually merge or replace main

#### Option 3: Fork and Evolve
- Fork original repository
- Rebrand as "UN-Enhanced Edition"
- Maintain connection to original

### Recommended Approach

1. **Create New Repository**
   ```
   cyberpunk-gm-screen-unenhanced
   ```

2. **Version Tag**: `v3.0.0-alpha`

3. **Tagline**: 
   > "The UN-Enhanced Edition - Because We're Just Getting Started!"

4. **README Structure**:
   - Acknowledge original project
   - Highlight new architecture
   - List all new features
   - "UN-Enhanced" roadmap

5. **Commit Strategy**:
   ```
   Initial commit: "🚀 UN-Enhanced Edition begins"
   Feature commits: "✨ Add [feature]"
   Fix commits: "🐛 Fix [issue]"
   Enhancement commits: "💎 Enhance [component]"
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Finalize repository decision**
2. **Prepare initial commit**
3. **Write compelling README**
4. **Set up GitHub Actions**
5. **Create project board**
6. **Tag v3.0.0-alpha**

## 💡 Marketing the "UN-Enhanced" Concept

```markdown
# Cyberpunk GM Screen - UN-Enhanced Edition™

> "It's called UN-Enhanced because we're just getting started, choom!"

While other GM screens might be "enhanced," ours is proudly UN-Enhanced - 
meaning there's always room for more chrome, more features, and more style.

Every update makes it LESS un-enhanced and MORE awesome.

Current UN-Enhancement Level: 15%
Target: ∞
