# Sound System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Object Reference**
**Problem**: The settings panel was looking for `window.soundManager` but the sound system is actually initialized as `window.soundSystem`.

**Solution**: Updated all references from `soundManager` to `soundSystem` in:
- Settings panel HTML generation
- Settings panel event handlers
- User profile manager

### 2. **Incorrect Property Access**
**Problem**: The code was trying to access properties directly (`.enabled`, `.volume`) instead of using the getter methods.

**Solution**: Changed to use the proper methods:
- `soundSystem.isEnabled()` instead of `soundSystem.enabled`
- `soundSystem.getVolume()` instead of `soundSystem.volume`
- `soundSystem.setEnabled(value)` for setting enabled state
- `soundSystem.setVolume(value)` for setting volume

### 3. **Audio Context Suspension**
**Problem**: Modern browsers suspend the audio context until user interaction, which can prevent sounds from playing.

**Solution**: Added audio context resume logic to the test button:
```javascript
if (window.soundSystem.audioContext && window.soundSystem.audioContext.state === 'suspended') {
  window.soundSystem.audioContext.resume().then(() => {
    window.soundSystem.play('sound-name');
  });
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. **cyberpunk-gm-screen.html**
- Fixed sound settings UI to use `window.soundSystem`
- Added proper getter methods for enabled state and volume
- Added event handlers that call the correct methods
- Added a "Test Sound" button to verify audio is working
- Added console logging for debugging

### 2. **src/js/user-profile-manager.js**
- Updated profile creation to use `soundSystem.isEnabled()` and `soundSystem.getVolume()`
- Fixed profile application to use `soundSystem.setEnabled()` and `soundSystem.setVolume()`
- Changed default volume from 0.5 to 0.3 to match the sound system default

## How the Sound System Works

### Architecture
The Enhanced Sound System uses the Web Audio API to generate synthetic cyberpunk-themed sounds:
- No external audio files needed
- All sounds are generated programmatically
- Uses oscillators, filters, and gain nodes for effects

### Sound Types Available
- `button-hover` - Subtle sine wave sweep
- `button-click` - Layered square and sawtooth waves
- `panel-open` - Rising frequency sweep
- `panel-close` - Falling frequency sweep
- `notification` - Alert-style beep
- `success` - Positive confirmation sound
- `error` - Warning/error sound
- `dice-roll` - Multiple clicking sounds
- `glitch` - Distorted digital noise
- `scan` - Scanning sweep effect
- `alert` - Urgent warning sound
- `menu-navigate` - Navigation feedback

### Storage
- Sound enabled state saved to: `cyberpunk-sound-enabled`
- Volume level saved to: `cyberpunk-sound-volume`
- Default volume: 30% (0.3)
- Default enabled: true

## Testing

### Test File
Created `test-sound-system.html` for comprehensive testing:
- Shows system status (loaded, enabled, volume, audio context state)
- Provides controls to toggle sound and adjust volume
- Has buttons to test all available sounds
- Shows debug log of all operations
- Updates status in real-time

### How to Test
1. Open the main application
2. Click Settings (⚙️) in the header
3. In the General tab, you'll see:
   - Checkbox to enable/disable sounds
   - Volume slider (0-100%)
   - "Test Sound" button
4. Click "Test Sound" to verify audio is working
5. The test will play two sounds: button click and notification

### Troubleshooting
If sounds don't play:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure the checkbox is checked (enabled)
3. Ensure volume is not at 0%
4. Click "Test Sound" to resume audio context if needed
5. Some browsers require user interaction before playing sounds

## Integration with User Profiles

The sound settings are now properly saved and restored with user profiles:
- When creating a profile: Current sound settings are captured
- When loading a profile: Sound settings are applied
- Settings saved: enabled state and volume level

## Browser Compatibility

The sound system works in all modern browsers that support Web Audio API:
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support (may require user interaction)
- Mobile browsers: Require user interaction to start

## Known Limitations

1. **First Interaction Required**: Due to browser autoplay policies, the first sound might not play until after user interaction
2. **Mobile Battery Saving**: Some mobile browsers may suspend audio to save battery
3. **Performance**: Generating sounds uses CPU, but impact is minimal with the current implementation
